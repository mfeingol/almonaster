<h2><a name="Introduction"><b>1.0 Introduction</b></a></h2>
<p><em>Almonaster</em> is a turn-based multi-player war game that runs on the
Web using form submissions as user input. No downloads are required and no Java,
ActiveX controls or support for scripting languages are needed. If you are
reading this page and your browser can post forms, then you can play.</p>
<p><em>Almonaster </em>was inspired by a long line of strategy games, especially
T&amp;E Software's <em>Daiva</em> series, which were programmed for the MSX2
computer. If you have an MSX2 emulator, you can run the 1986 game <a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/msx/games/msx2/disk/DAIVAS5.LZH">Daiva
story V</a>, which was way ahead of its time.</p>
<p>The design of <em>Almonaster</em> was also heavily influenced by the popular
online game <em>Stellar Crisis</em>, and the look and feel of <em>Almonaster</em>
has been designed to be familiar and usable by those who are familiar with <em>Stellar
Crisis</em> 2.8x. <em>Stellar Crisis</em> resources that may be useful for a
better understanding of <em>Almonaster </em>culture and gameplay include:

<h2><a name="Objective"><b>1.1 The basic objective</b></a></h2>
<p><em>Almonaster </em>is a game of strategy played on a planetary scale, in
which multiple empires vie for the control of a galaxy.</p>
<p>The objective of an <em>Almonaster</em> game is to develop a small planetary
civilization into a galactic empire, overcoming enemy aliens and creating
powerful coalitions with friendly races. There is no artificial intelligence
built into <em>Almonaster</em> (yet); every empire that one might encounter
belongs to another player logged in via the Internet. A game ends when there are
no more enemies left in the galaxy: either only one empire remains or those who
remain are all in a state of alliance. Empires are eliminated by destroying
their homeworld with a nuclear weapon unleashed by a ship or fleet of ships.</p>
<p>However, <em>Almonaster</em> is more than a simple war game. It is possible
to establish diplomatic relationships with other empires, which can range from
all-out war to resource sharing alliances. Different players have different
means of achieving the goal of supreme domination of the universe: some prefer
to establish multiple liaisons and use teamwork to defeat their opponents, while
others opt for more individualistic approaches. There are game types that allow
and encourage alliances and others that force empires to survive on their own.
The central virtue of <em>Almonaster</em> gameplay is that there is a great
diversity of roles, strategies and options to explore, so no two games are ever
alike.</p>
<h2><a name="Basic">1.2 The basic rules</a></h2>
<p>An <em>Almonaster</em> game is assigned a predetermined amount of time that
serves as an interval between turns or &quot;updates.&quot; When an update is
executed by the server, the orders entered by a player on behalf of his empire
are processed. These orders include such actions as building or moving ships,
executing special actions such as colonizing a planet, nuking a planet,
terraforming a planet or changing diplomatic status with another empire.</p>
<p><em>Almonaster</em> games are based upon a map of planets, which can be
thought of as a connected graph. Each planet would be a node in the graph and
each link between planets a connections between one node and another. Links
between planets indicate paths for ships to travel along.</p>
<p>Ships can move one &quot;jump&quot; or perform one special action per update.
There are several different types of ships that can perform different types of
actions. For example, &quot;science&quot; ships can explore along previously
uncovered links; &quot;colony&quot; ships can colonize unclaimed planets; etc.
All mobile ships can &quot;nuke,&quot; which is the action that returns
colonized planets to unclaimed status and reduces their resource levels.</p>
<p>Each empire begins with the ownership of one planet, which is called a
&quot;home world.&quot; The links off the home world will usually be unexplored
at the beginning of the game, so the first action of an empire in any game will
be to construct science ships and begin exploring the galaxy. When ships from
different empires meet for the first time, combat will occur and the empires
will be inserted into each other's &quot;diplomacy&quot; screens, allowing them
to establish different diplomatic levels: war, truce, trade or alliance.</p>
<p>Ship combat resolution in <em>Almonaster</em> is rather complex. A simple
formulation would be as follows: ships will fight until the greater force has
completely eliminated the lesser force. Note that ships belonging at truce or
greater with one another will fight as a unit against a common foe. It is also
important to observe that there is no random element whatsoever in ship combat
resolution. A more detailed discussion of ship combat can be found in <a href="#ShipCombat">section
4.1</a> and <a href="#ShipCombat2">section 4.1.1</a>.</p>
<p>The economic aspect of <em>Almonaster</em> is very important. Each planet
possess three different resource parameters: agriculture, fuel and minerals. The
former allows population to increase on a planet and exploit the other two,
which allow empires to build more ships. Agriculture is shared amongst all the
planets in the empire, so planets with great agricultural resources but small
amounts of minerals or fuel are still very valuable.</p>
<p>Ships can only be built on planets that possess a high population level, so
it is important to colonize planets with agriculture early and allow their
populations to grow.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of a game is technological development. An empire
develops a certain technological level based upon the amount of resources (fuel
and minerals) that it has and the amount that it consumes each update in the
building and maintenance of ships. The less resources consumed, the more the
technological level will increase each update. At certain fixed intervals (when
the technology level reaches certain values) the empire gains the capacity to
build stronger ships, which can give it decisive advantages in ship combat.</p>
<p>An <em>Almonaster</em> game ends when one empire or coalition of allied
empires obliterates every other empire. An empire is obliterated when its home
world is nuked by an opponent, in which case all of its colonized planets become
unclaimed.</p>
<h2><a name="Strategies">1.3 The basic strategies</a></h2>
<p>Therefore, successful<em> Almonaster </em>play requires players to balance
the following aspects:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exploration</strong> - The greater the percentage of the full map
    available to a player, the better his chances of success. Exploration is
    needed both to find resource-laden planets to colonize and to view enemy
    empires' activities.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Colonization</strong> - Once explored, planets must be colonized
    and defended against enemy ships that may be in the vicinity. The more
    planets colonized, the better an empire's economy and the higher its chances
    of success.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Defense</strong> - Other empires will compete for planets in
    &quot;no-man's-land&quot; and will attempt to weaken each other by nuking
    their already-colonized planets. Defensive measures will be required to
    defeat invaders.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Attack </strong>- The best defense is a good attack; the best way
    to keep an empire busy is to attack it and force it to defend itself.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Technological development</strong> - If an empire spends too many
    resources building ships, then its technological development will suffer and
    more frugal empires will in the long run be able to develop stronger fleets
    and win the decisive battles.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Sometimes the best way to &quot;beat&quot; a
    strong enemy is to join him. Successful choices of alliance partners can
    lead to victories that would otherwise be impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>The successful <em>Almonaster</em> player will learn to balance these aspects
and achieve a healthy economy through exploration and colonization while
maintaining a high technological level, stopping enemy probes from exploring its
territory and establishing relationships of alliance with other empires of
similar potency.</p>

<h2><a name="SystemInterface"><b>2.0 The System Interface</b></a></h2>
<p>The first thing that has to be done in order to play on an <em>Almonaster</em>
server is to create a new empire with a password. Once this is done one can
begin to use the resources on the server: edit one's profile, search for other
empires, chat with fellow players, join games currently in progress and start
new games.</p>
<h2><a name="Login">2.1 The Login screen</a></h2>
<p>This is the first screen that players see when they connect to an <em>Almonaster</em>
server. This screen allows players who have already created empires to access
the server by simply typing in a valid empire's name and password. New empires
can be created by typing in an otherwise unused empire name and a password to be
used with it. If the empire name is not in use on the server, then the player
will be directed to the New Empire screen.</p>
<p>It should be noted that empire names are case insensitive and all initial and
trailing spaces in the names are stripped by the server. Therefore, the names
&quot;PlanetCrusher&quot; and &quot; pLaNeTcRuShEr &quot; correspond to the same
empire. In addition, passwords containing characters from outside the range
between ASCII character 35 (#) and ASCII character 126 (~) will be rejected.</p>
<h2><a name="NewEmpire">2.2 The New Empire screen</a></h2>
<p>This screen is reached when a new empire is created. It requires the player
who is creating the new empire to verify (retype) the password that he or she
entered in the Login screen and enter basic information about the empire, such
as its owner's real name, email address, web page URL and favorite quote. Except
for the password verification, the information requested on this screen is
voluntary and can be left blank.</p>
<p>An option available to experienced players who wish to start off a new empire
with the same privileges as their old empire is the possibility of allowing
newly created empires to inherit a previous empire's <em>Almonaster</em> score
and privileges. This can be accomplished by typing in the name and password of
the &quot;parent&quot; empire into the forms at the bottom of the screen. The
parent empire will be deleted during this process; therefore, it must not be in
any games, or else the new empire will not be able to inherit from it.</p>
<p>After an empire has been successfully created (or the player has correctly
logged in through the Login menu), the Active Game List will appear, with the
following menu:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Resource/Faq/ActiveGameList.gif" alt="ActiveGameList" width="187" height="24">

<h2><a name="ActiveGameList">2.3 The Active Game List</a></h2>
<p>The Active Game List provides a list of the games that the logged-in empire
is currently playing. Clicking on a <img src="Resource/Faq/Login.gif" alt="Exit" width="76" height="24">
button will lead to the introductory screen for the selected game.</p>
<h2><a name="OpenGameList">2.4 The Open Game List</a></h2>
<p>The Open Game List provides a list of games that are currently being played
on the server and that the logged-in empire has permission to view. Clicking on
an <img src="Resource/Faq/EnterGame.gif" alt="EnterGame" width="135" height="24">
button will allow the player to join the selected game.</p>
<h2><a name="SystemGameList">2.5 The System Game List</a></h2>
<p>The System Game List provides a list of the game classes that are currently
available on the server and that the logged-in empire has permission to view.
Clicking on a <img src="Resource/Faq/StartGame.gif" alt="Exit" width="130" height="24">
button will allow the player to start a new game. The password field exists to
create a password protected game, and should be left blank if no password is
desired.</p>
<p>The System Game List also allows empires with privilege levels equal or
superior to 'Apprentice' to create their own custom games. More information
about custom games and privileges is available in <a href="#PersonalGameClasses">
section 2.14</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Nomenclature">2.5.1 Game class options</a></h2>
<p>To the <em>Almonaster</em> beginner, the  fields that describe game
class characteristics may be somewhat confusing:</p>

<h2><a name="GamePlay">2.5.2 How game class options affect game play</a></h2>
<p><em>Almonaster</em> allows administrators to create game classes (game types)
designed with custom parameters. Among these parameters are some that greatly
affect game play:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Update time</strong> - Blitzes (games that update once every
    several minutes) demand different strategies than longterms (games that
    update every day).<br>
    The former require succinct communications between allies and rapid
    decision-making skills, because players may not have the time to examine the
    map and the game situation exhaustively before they are forced to make a
    decision. The latter require a more reasoned approach to the game and more
    developed diplomatic skills, which might allow players to obtain temporary
    cease-fires or trade agreements with otherwise non-friendly empires.<br>
    Other requirements of long-term games include superior strategic planning
    abilities, because every player in the game will have greater opportunities
    to analyze the situation of his empire or coalition and plan accordingly.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Number of empires</strong> - Game classes can have different
    maximum and minimum numbers of empires. The minimum number needed for a game
    is two, and the maximum number can be as high as the administrator's whim.
    In general, however, more than fifteen or twenty empires per game would be
    terribly confusing in anything but a longterm.<br>
    Games with only two players (grudge matches) are different from other types
    of games because diplomatic considerations are unimportant.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Number of planets</strong> - The number of planets per empire in a
    game can range from three to about twenty. The opening strategies for small
    numbers of planets are different from those for large number of planets
    because large galaxies lead to situations where some empires, through luck
    of the map layout or diplomatic inability, are allowed to expand freely
    while others run into competing neighbours immediately.<br>
    This leads to inequalities in resource distribution that are not as present
    in games with smaller maps. These inequalities lead to the existence of
    exceptional diplomatic situations, such as temporary alliances and
    coalitions, back-stabbing and information leaking.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Technology delta</strong> - Different game classes can have
    different default technology increases per update. Games with larger
    increases will lead to greater technological differences between different
    empires, but these differences will rarely be decisive because technology
    can be acquired easily. On the other hand, games with smaller increases will
    usually allow technological parity to be maintained between empires.
    However, should a difference occur, it would be almost decisive in
    determining which empire or coalition would win.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Diplomatic settings</strong> - There are games that do not allow
    the full set of diplomatic settings (war, truce, trade, alliance) to be
    used. Some games fix diplomatic settings at &quot;war,&quot; thus impeding
    all diplomatic arrangements outside of tacit non-agression agreements. Other
    games only allow &quot;war&quot; and &quot;truce&quot; or &quot;trade,&quot;
    which leads to situations where coalitions may be formed, but they can never
    be permanent and every action must be performed with the idea that one will
    eventually be forced to attempt to destroy one's partners and vice-versa.
    This type of game makes for interesting relationships of trust.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Shared maps</strong> - Some game classes allow maps to be shared
    between allies. What this means is that if empire A explores planet X, all
    empires allied to empire A will see planet X added to their maps. This
    allows more effective sharing of information between allied empires, and it
    also increases the uncertainty concerning which empires have access to which
    planets.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Invisible builds</strong> - It is possible for <em>Almonaster</em>
    administrators to create game classes that by default do not display ships
    built during the current update on the map screen. This further reduces the
    amount of information available to players concerning each other's
    activities, and it allows empires to experiment with building fleets without
    leaking this information to the outside.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Available ship types</strong> - Some game classes do not allow
    empires to develop and build all of the different ship types available in <em>Almonaster
    </em>in general. The effects of this restriction depend on the ship types 
  that are eliminated. For example, if stargates or jumpgates (which are ships that
    teleport other ships from one planet to another) cannot be built, then the
    acquisition of build-capable planets near the battle front becomes
    essential.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Private messages</strong> - In some game classes, empires are not
    allowed to send private messages to other empires. In these games, they are
    forced to communicate sensitive information through the use of insecure
    channels such as open broadcasts, planet and ship renaming, or through the
    development of special codes.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="ResourceAssignment">2.5.3 How resources are assigned to planets</a></h2>
<p>When a game begins and the game's map is generated, resources (amounts of
minerals, fuel and agriculture units) are assigned to each planet. These numbes
are obtained in the following manner:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the average resource totals for each planet are variable, a random
    number is chosen between the minimum and maximum limits for each resource.
    Otherwise, the fixed average resources totals are used.</li>
  <li>The average resource total for each planet is multiplied by the number of
    planets to be created per empire: this returns the total number of resources
    to be assigned to the group of planets, for each resource type.</li>
  <li>Random numbers between 0 and the average resource total for a planet
    multiplied by a server specific variable known as the Resource Allocation
    Randomization Factor are chosen for each planet and for each resource type.
    The random values are added together, normalized to the desired total
    calculated in step 2 and adjusted for floating point errors.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="ProfileViewer">2.6 The Profile Viewer</a></h2>
<p>The Profile Viewer is designed to allow players to search for other empires and view their profile information.
<a href="#PersonalGameClasses">Novice</a> empires can only search for other
empires by name, but those with privilege levels greater than novice can choose
a more advanced search form that allows searching for empires by many

    automatically deleted by the system. Halted empires can be
    &quot;undeleted&quot; from the Profile Editor and restored to their normal
    state.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="TopLists"><b>2.8 Top Lists</b></a></h2>
<p>The Top Lists screen allows players to look up empires by rank using various 
scoring systems.</p>
<p>To understand this screen, it should be explained that an empire can only
defeat another empire by obliterating the latter's homeworld. This is
accomplished by using one or more uncontested ships to nuke the homeworld in
question. An empire obtains a <em>nuke </em>when it obliterates another empire.
The obliterated empire in turn obtains a <em>nuked</em>. If an empire ends a
game as a member of the winning coalition it obtains a <em>win</em>. A <em>draw </em>is
obtained when all remaining empires agree to cease all hostilities and end the 
game without a winner.</p>

<h2><a name="ClassicScore">2.8.1 Classic Score</a></h2>

<p>Classic Score is defined as the following formula:</p>
<p><em>Wins + 0.25 * Draws + 0.5 * (Nukes - Nuked) - Ruins</em></p>

<p>This scoring system is a
relic of <em>Stellar Crisis</em> gameplay, more significant to old-timers than
to beginning players.</p>
<h2><a name="AlmonasterScore">2.8.2 <i>Almonaster</i> Score</a></h2>
<p><em>Almonaster</em> Score is far more complicated than Classic Score, and is
used to restrict game access. It is intended to be a more accurate measure of
player quality than the Classic Score, which measures mostly quantity.</p>
<p>The core notion of <em>Almonaster</em> Score is the concept of a Base Unit
(BU). The BU is the amount of points that is given to an empire that nukes
another empire of equal quality and the amount that is subtracted from an empire
nuked by another of equal quality and with an equal number of allies and trade
partners.</p>
<p>The quality of an empire, of course, is measured in <em>Almonaster </em>points,
so the <em>Almonaster </em>Score can be thought of as a recursively defined
ladder system. If the interacting empires are not equivalent in quality, then
the quotient of their scores is used to multiple the BU. E.g., if empire A with
10 points nukes empire B with 20, A will gain BU * (20 / 10) points and B will
lose BU * (20 / 10) points.</p>
<p>However, a good quality empire can easily be nuked by a low quality opponent,
if that opponent has allies to support it and outnumber the better empire. The <em>Almonaster
</em>Score takes this problem into account with the notion of an alliance ratio
(AR), which is the number of allies and trade partners the nuked empire has
divided by the number of allies and trade partners the nuking empire has. The
alliance ratio is capped by the system's minimum alliance ratio and maximum
alliance ratio.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a good quality empire with many games on a server and a high
score can be nuked by an empire with no record (and thus, a low score) whose
owner is actually quite good. To solve this problem, the <i>Almonaster</i> score
uses two separate significance ratios: the Nuker's Significance Ratio (RSR) and
the Nuked Significance Ratio (DSR), which are separately capped by system
defined minimum and maximum values.
<p>Other important constants that are used:
<ul>
  <li>The Minimum Score (mS), usually defined as 10. No empire's score can drop
    below the mS.</li>
  <li>The Maximum Decrease Factor (MDF): with an equal number of allies and
    equal score significance, an empire can lose a maximum MDF * BU points from
    a single nuke.</li>
  <li>The Maximum Increase Factor (MIF): with an equal number of allies and
    equal score significance, an empire can gain a maximum of MIF * BU points
    from a single nuke.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter two are introduced to reduce the results of score disparities to
reasonable levels.</p>
<p>To summarize, one one would express the <em>Almonaster </em>Score in <strong>C</strong>
in the following manner:</p>

<h2><a name="BridierScore">2.8.3 Bridier Score</a></h2>
<p>The <strong style="font-weight: 400">Bridier scoring system</strong> was 
designed for chess and adapted for Stellar Crisis 3.x by <a href="http://insomnia.nexen.net/">Jerome
    Zago</a>. It attempts to perform the same type of evaluation of an empire's 
quality that the Almonaster Score does, but only for selected one-on-one 
(grudge) games. More information about the Bridier scoring system can be found 
on Jerome's <a href="http://insomnia.nexen.net/scrank.php">website</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Chatroom">2.10 The Chatroom</a></h2>
<p>The Chatroom is a simple implementation of an IRC-like message board
designed for those who wish to find a quick opponent or are incapable or
unwilling to access real IRC channels. The chat room keeps a certain number of
messages stored in memory and has an upper limit on the number of empires who
can share the room simultaneously. Empires who enter the chat room and do not
post a message for a certain period of time will time out.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the basic rules of civility that govern all Internet
communications also apply to the <em>Almonaster</em> chat room.</p>
<h2><a name="Spectators">2.11 Spectator Games</a></h2>
<p>The Spectator Games page lists all games that have been created such that 
they can be viewed by spectators. From this page players can view the full maps of 
these games, as well as some information about the empires playing the games. In 
order for a game to qualify for this page, it must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have an exposed map</li>
  <li>Have exposed diplomacy</li>
  <li>Be made available to spectators from the <a href="#AdvancedOptions">Advanced 
  Options</a> page, or be started on a server that has spectator availability 
  enabled as the default.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="LatestNukes">2.12 Latest Nukes</a></h2>
<p>The Latest Nukes displays a summary of the latest nukes that occurred on the 
server. It lists empire names, game names and numbers, and the times that the 
nuke occurred.</p>
<h2><a name="Exit">2.13 Exit</a></h2>
<p>The exit button will take players who press it back to the <a href="#Login">Login</a>
screen and allow them to use different empires or create new ones.</p>
<h2><a name="PersonalGameClasses">2.14 Privileges</a></h2>
<p>There are five levels of privilege in <em>Almonaster</em>:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Novice</strong>: this is the default privilege level assigned to
    all newly created empires. Novices can play any game that their score allows
    them to play, and can customize their profiles to their hearts' desires.</li>
  <li><b>Apprentice</b>: this level is attained when an empire has won a few
    games and can be considered to be somewhat knowledgeable about the game.
    Apprentices can create their own custom games from the <a href="#SystemGameList">System
    Game List</a>, which can have the specs that the player desires, within
    administrator-configured restrictions on their characteristics. Regardless
    of score restrictions, custom game owners can always enter their own games.
    Apprentices also have access to the advanced search interface in the <a href="#ProfileViewer">Profile
    Viewer</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Adept</strong>: this level is attained when an empire reaches a
    certain level of expertise with the game, as measured by its <em>Almonaster</em>
    Score or when a new empire inherits from an old empire with Adept
    privileges. Adepts have all the privileges of Apprentices plus the ability
    to create &quot;personal&quot; gameclasses which can be started from their <a href="#ProfileViewer">profile</a>
    screens and entered from the <a href="#OpenGameList">Open Game List</a>.
    There is an upper limit on the number of personal gameclasses an empire can
    create, and their characteristics are under the same restrictions that
    custom games are. Regardless of score restrictions, gameclass owners can
    always enter their own games.</li>
  <li><strong>Administrator</strong>: there is one default administrator when a
    server is set up, but there can be any number of empires with administrative
    privileges. An administrator has the following abilities beyond the
    privileges of Adepthood:
    <ul>
      <li>Server administration: administrators can rename the server, introduce
        new alien icons, change server parameters, backup the database, change
        the default ship names, change the default themes, etc.</li>
      <li>Game administration: administrators can create and delete superclasses
        (groups of gameclasses) and individual gameclasses, as well as view
        information about active games (and kill them).</li>
      <li>Empire administration: administrators can send messages to all
        empires, change empire privileges and delete empires.</li>
      <li>Theme administration: administrators can add, rename, delete and
        configure the system themes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Administrators can also join any game, regardless of score limitations
    and have the right to delete other empires' personal game classes.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Guest</b>: this is a privilege level that is used for the default guest
    empire and as a punishment for empires whose right to enter games the
    administrator wishes to remove, but without deleting them. A Guest empire cannot
    enter or create games, even games it is already in. However, Guest empires
    can view all open games, regardless of score restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that players understand the meaning of the different <a href="#Nomenclature">game
class options</a> available to them before creating their own custom games or
game classes.</p>
<h2><a name="ServerRules">2.15 Server rules</a></h2>
<p>The Server Rules screen provides information about game variables that are
server or version specific. It also provides data concerning the state of the
server process and the traffic the web server has serviced since it last started
up. This information is required reading for players new to <i>Almonaster</i> or to a
particular server.</p>
<h2><a name="root">2.16 root</a></h2>
<p>root, the default administrative empire created during system setup, is
considered special by the server: root cannot be deleted, downgraded from
administrative status, prevented from broadcasting, have its password changed,
have its scores changed or blanked, or have its personal game classes deleted,
even by another administrator.</p>
<h2><a name="guest">2.17 guest</a></h2>
<p>guest, the default Guest empire created during system setup, is considered
special by the server: guest cannot be deleted, upgraded from Guest status,
allowed to broadcast, change its own password, have its scores changed or
blanked, create or enter games, create personal game classes. However, guest,
like all empires with Guest status, can view all entries in all game lists on a server,
regardless of score restrictions.</p>
<h2><a name="Autologon">2.18 Empire autologon</a></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;option exists on <i>Almonaster</i> servers to configure an empire
for autologon. This option can be both activated and deactivated in the <a href="#ProfileEditor">Profile
Editor</a>.</p>
  <p>When autologon is configured, the player's browser will provide the server
  with the identity of the desired empire and its password in the form of a
  cookie. The player will be directly presented with the <a href="#ActiveGameList">Active
  Game List</a>, directly bypassing the login screen. A failure in the autologon
  process will cause autologon to be turned off, and the player will simply be
  presented with a logon screen.</p>
  
<h2><a name="AdvancedOptions">2.19 Advanced Options</a></h2>

<p>When a game is created from the <a href="#SystemGameList">System Game List</a> 
with the Advanced checkbox selected, a menu will appear with options that the 
player can use to configure the new game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Updates before game closes</b> is the maximum number of updates that 
  can occur before the game closes. While a game is still open, other empires 
  can still join, end turn has no effect and the game cannot end.</li>
  <li><b>First update delay </b>is an additional period of time that will be 
  added to the first update of the game. It is usually used to allow time for 
  more empires to join a game before it closes.</li>
  <li><b>Message sent to empires entering the game </b>is a message from the 
  game's creator that is sent to all empires who join the game.</li>
  <li><b>Bridier configuration</b> is an option that determines if the game 
  counts toward the <a href="#Bridier">Bridier </a>scoring system. It is 
  available in two-empire games.</li>
  <li><b>Empire names exposed </b>is an option that determines if the names of 
  the empires in the game will be exposed in the game list. It also determines 
  if empire names will be broadcasted when they enter the game.</li>
  <li><b>Game available to spectators</b> is only available for games with 
  exposed maps and diplomacy. It determines if a game will be visible from
  <a href="#SpectatorGames">Spectator Games </a>screen.</li>
  <li><b>Password protection</b> allows entrance into the new game to be 
  restricted to those players who know the password selected by the creator.</li>
  <li><b>Empire filtering by scores</b> allows entrance into the new game to be 
  restricted to those empires whose scores fall within the limits selected by 
  the creator. Restrictions defined here do not apply to administrators, to the 
  owner of the game class, or to the creator of the game.</li>
  <li><b>Empire filtering by IP address and Session Id</b> allows entrance into 
  the new game to be restricted to empires whose IP addresses and Session Ids 
  are not duplicates of other empires already in the game. The creator can elect 
  to allow all empires access to the game, to deny access to the game to empires 
  with duplicate IP addresses or Session Ids, or simply to warn the other 
  empires in the game that an empire with a duplicate IP address or Session Id 
  has entered the game. Needless to say, because of the disconnected nature of 
  HTTP, it is not possible to
prevent multiple empires belonging to the same player from joining a game, but these options  make it somewhat
difficult for empires to do so without being detected. The <a href="#Options">Options</a>
screen also allows players to search their current games for empires with duplicate IP
addresses or Session Ids.</li>
  <li><b>Block specific empires</b> allows the creator to specify specific 
  empires who cannot enter the game. Empires with the same IP address or Session 
  Id can also be blocked. There is no limit on the number of empires that can be 
  filtered.</li>
</ul>

<p>The top third of the screen describes the state of the game:
<ul>
  <li>If an empire is &quot;ready for an update&quot;, then the empire has
    finished making its moves for the current update and has clicked on the End
    Turn button, thus signaling its readiness to move on to the next update.
    When all empires have clicked on End Turn, an update will occur, regardless
    of the time remaining in the current update period. This ensures that games
    move along quickly and time is not wasted waiting for the timer to run down.
    When an empire is ready for an update, it has the option of clicking on the
    Unend Turn button, which sets it back to a non-ready state.</li>
  <li>If an empire leaves the game and is does not log in for a certain number
    of turns (usually one or two), it will be considered idle and will always be
    ready for an update. This will occur until the empire's owner logs into the
    game again.</li>
</ul>
<p>The middle third of the screen describes the resources available to the
empire:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Minerals </strong>are used to build and maintain ships. The total
    listed here is the sum of the exploited mineral units of each planet owned
    by the empire. A planet can exploit mineral units in a number equivalent to
    its population size. For example, a planet with 60 mineral units and 42
    population units will only provide 42 mineral units to the empire's total.</li>
  <li><strong>Fuel </strong>is used to provide power to existing ships. The
    total listed here is the sum of the exploited fuel units of each planet
    owned by the empire. Fuel units are exploited by a planet's population
    exactly like mineral units..</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture </strong>is used to feed planetary populations. Excess
    agriculture leads to population growth, which in turn allows planets to
    exploit their resources to the fullest and makes the empire stronger.
    Agriculture does not require exploiting, so the total listed here is simply
    the sum of the agriculture units of the planets owned by the empire.</li>
  <li><strong>Population </strong>is the sum of the individual planetary
    populations of all the planets that are owned by the empire.</li>
  <li><strong>Target population</strong> is the sum of the individual maximum
    populations of all the planets that are owned by the empire. The maximum
    population of a planet is a value specified by the player in the <a href="#Map">Map</a>
    or <a href="#Planets">Planets</a> screen that limits the population growth
    on a given planet. This maximum population of a planet defaults to the
    agriculture level of the planet. The reason an empire might want to limit
    the population of its planets is because there is a limited amount of
    agriculture to go around, and if a planet's population is already exploiting
    the mineral and fuel units of the planet to their fullest, there is rarely a
    reason to have more population units on that planet.</li>
  <li>The<strong> tech level</strong>,<strong> tech increase</strong> and <strong>battle
    rank</strong> are explained in <a href="#Technology">section 3.11</a>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>next tech level</strong> is defined as the tech level that the
    empire will have after the next update occurs.</li>
  <li>The <strong>next battle rank</strong> is defined as the battle rank that
    the empire will have after the next update occurs.</li>
  <li><strong>Planets</strong> and <strong>ships</strong> refer respectively to
    the number of planets and ships that the empire owns</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom third of the screen describes the usage level of the empire's
resources, expressed through various ratios:
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>maintenance ratio</strong> is the number of mineral units
    divided by the number of mineral units in use. The use of this ratio is
    described in <a href="#Ships">section 3.6</a>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>fuel use ratio</strong> is the number of fuel units divided by
    the number of fuel units in use. The use of this ratio is described in <a href="#ShipCombat2">section
    4.11</a>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>agriculture ratio</strong> is the number of agriculture units
    divided by the total number of population units. This ratio multiplies the
    population of every planet at each update and increases the population of
    the planet by that amount (trimmed to the max pop, of course).</li>
  <li>The <strong>next maintenance</strong>, <strong>fuel use </strong>and <strong>agriculture
    ratios</strong> are defined as the estimated values the <strong>maintenance</strong>,
    <strong>fuel use </strong>and <strong>agriculture ratios </strong>will be
    after the next update. These values take into account such factors as max
    population settings and ship construction and dismantling, and are useful
    when <a href="#OverBuild">overbuilding</a> or <a href="#PopTrick">pop
    tricking</a>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>total build cost</strong> is the number of mineral units used
    in building ships during the current update.</li>
  <li>The <strong>total maintenance cost</strong> is the number of mineral units
    used in repairing and maintaining ships' battle readiness.</li>
  <li>The<strong> total fuel use </strong>is the number of fuel units used to
    make currently existing ships function.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Technology">3.1.1 Technological levels</a></h2>
<p>The technological level of an empires is a floating point number that begins
each game set at an initial level (usually at least 1.0). As the updates
progress, each empire's level increases depending on the amount of resources
(minerals and fuel) that it is using and what maximum tech increase the game
class allows. At a high level, this formula can be thought of as:</p>
<p>Tech Increase = (1 - Resources used / Total Resources) * Max GameClass Tech
Increase</p>
<p>This allows empires that use few resources in building or maintaining
existing ships to develop high technological levels. On the other hand,
over-ambitious empires that build too many ships are penalized as time passes,
because their technological levels will be inferior to those of their opponents.</p>
<p>Technological development is useful for two different reasons:
<ol>
  <li>Ships built by empires with higher technological levels are more effective
    in battle.</li>
  <li>As empires reach higher levels, they can develop new types of ships not
    available at the beginning of the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>The important notion to grasp is that <strong>effective technology levels </strong>increase
by cut-off points. The floor of the square root of an empire's technological
level (the battle rank, or <strong>BR</strong>) is the relevant number in
determining both ship capacity and the availabilility of new ship types. When
this number increases (as it does when the technological level reaches 4.0, 9.0,
16.0, 25.0, 36.0, etc.), the BR of the empires is said to increase (to 2, 3, 4,
5 and 6, respectively). As a consequence, an additional ship type can be
developed and more powerful ships can be built.</p>
<p>The rationale for using a geometric system rather than a linear one is
simple: the intention was to make it increasingly difficult to reach the next BR
level. There are two ways to explain why this is desirable:
<ol>
  <li>The &quot;realistic&quot; explanation is that once a certain level of ship
    building expertise is achieved, it becomes increasingly harder to build
    better ships. Once every ship has a warp drive, a photon cannon and nuclear
    bombing capabilities, what else can one add? In other words, it takes more
    R&amp;D efforts to improve better ship designs than it does to improve worse
    ship designs.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The &quot;game-play&quot; explanation is that a linear system would lead
    to constant imbalance between empires at different technological levels. The
    increasing &quot;space&quot; between BR levels helps to balance out
    inequalities between empires with different resource levels and building
    needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The effectiveness of a ship in combat is actually the square of its
current-BR. So a BR6 ship will fight with 36 combat &quot;points.&quot; The most
important consequence of this is that ships with higher BR's are <em>much</em>
more effective in combat that ships with lower BR's, and this difference in
effectiveness increases as the respective BR's are higher. The
&quot;realistic&quot; rationale here is that once the massive R&amp;D efforts
described in explanation (1) are made, the result is actually quite worth the
expenditure.</p>
<p>One might think that this squaring of the current-BR simply eliminates the
square-root formula for calculating BR, and therefore contradicts explanation
(2) above. This is not the case: ships built by an empire with technological
level 48.0 are no more powerful than those built by an empire with technological
level 36.0. Therefore, technological inequalities between different empires are
not as much balanced out as <em>dampened </em>through the use of the geometric
BR scale.</p>
<h2><a name="ShipTypes">3.1.2 Ship types</a></h2>
<p>There are sixteen different ship types in <em>Almonaster</em>. All ships have 
the same offensive and defensive capabilities at the same BR, but many have 
special abilities that differentiate them from the others:<ul>
  <li><strong>Attack:</strong> it has no special abilities, but is cheap to
    produce and is therefore used mainly to create large fleets.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Science: </strong>it can traverse unexplored links and increase
    the empire's visible map area.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Colony:</strong> it can colonize unclaimed planets and settle
    (deposit population on) already colonized planets.&nbsp; Colonies can also
    be set to colonize or settle, in which case if another colony ship belonging
    to the same empire manages to colonize the planet first, the second colony
    will add its population to the planet as if it had been instructed to settle
    it. Building a colony leads to a certain population cost at the planet where
    a colony is built. This cost is deferred until the next update and are
    subtracted from the planets population after the&nbsp;ag ratio is applied.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Stargate:</strong> it cannot move from the planet where it is
    built, but can teleport ships and fleets to other planets colonized by its 
  owner in a single update.
    A stargate loses a server defined amount of BR every time it is used. If a 
  planet's ownership changed during the update in which it was being gated to, 
  the gate action will succeed.<p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Cloaker:</strong> it has the ability to become invisible and move
    around without being detected by enemies. Cloakers cannot nuke a planet
    unless they are uncloaked, however.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Satellite:</strong> it cannot move from the planet where it is
    built, but is cheap to build and is used mainly for defensive purposes.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Terraformer:</strong> it can increase the agriculture level of a
    planet to the maximum of the planet's fuel and mineral totals. The amount
    that is increased is the ship's BR multiplied by a server defined amount.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Troopship:</strong> it can invade planets owned by other empires
    and independent planets. Invasions are successful if the ship's BR
    multiplied by a server defined number is greater than the total population
    of the planet. A failed invasion destroys a server defined amount of
    population units on the planet, usually a multiple of the ship's BR.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Doomsday:</strong> it can annihilate a planet, reducing its
    agriculture level to zero and placing it in a quarantined state for a number
    of updates equal to the ship's BR multiplied by a server defined value. A
    doomsday can only act upon uncolonized or independent planets, the empire's
    own planets (except the empire's homeworld) or planets belonging to empires
    at war with the owner of the doomsday.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Minefield:</strong> it cannot move from the planet where it is
    built, but when destroyed it explodes and destroys every other ship on the
    planet, unless a minesweeper is present after the ship battle ends. It can 
  also be detonated at any moment by its owner.<p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Minesweeper:</strong> it nullifies the effects of exploding
    minefields. Minesweepers are present in any serious attacking fleet.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Engineer: </strong>it can open and close links between planets, at
    a server-defined cost to its BR.<p>&nbsp;</li>
  
 <li><strong>Carrier:</strong> it behaves like an advanced attack ship that can 
 absorb large amounts of damage done by opponents during fleet battles.<p>&nbsp;</li>
    
  <li><strong>Builder:</strong> it has the ability to build new planets from 
  empty space. The quality of the new planets depends on the BR of the builder.<p>&nbsp;</li>
    
  <li><strong>Morpher:</strong> a jack of all trades, it has the ability to 
  change its shape from one ship type to another, from among the technologies 
  developed
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
    
  <li><strong>Jumpgate:</strong> it behaves similarly to a stargate, but it can 
  teleport ships and fleets to any planet, and not just to those colonized by the owner of 
  the jumpgate. They cannot send ships and fleets to planets that are under 
  quarantine after being annihilated by a doomsday.<p>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ShipCosts">3.1.3 Ship costs</a></h2>

<p>The following table displays the costs of building and keeping ships alive. 
The build and maintenance costs count against the empire's minerals, while the 
fuel cost counts (logically) against the empire's fuel. All costs will detract 
from technology development. If a ship loses MaxBR through special actions or 
other mechanisms, it will cost its owner the same amount of resources as the 
same ship type built at the new MaxBR level.</p>

<h2><a name="Options">3.2 The Options screen</a></h2>
<p>The options screen allows players to choose various options for the current
game:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Placement of command buttons:</strong> the command buttons can be
    repeated at the bottom of the screen if the player wishes it. This is useful
    for large screens in which a lot of scrolling is needed to go from the
    bottom to the top.</li>
  <li><strong>Javascript refresh upon update countdown: </strong>when this
    option is selected, the screen will automatically refresh itself when the
    update timer counts down to zero. This option requires a Javascript enabled
    browser.</li>
  <li><strong>Javascript update countdown:</strong> when this option is
    selected, a form field will display a graphical countdown timer indicating
    exactly how much time remains in the current update. This option requires a
    Javascript enabled browser.</li>
  <li><b>Map coloring by diplomatic status:</b> when this option is selected,
    map screens will color the text in planet representations with the colors
    corresponding to the diplomatic status of the owner of the planet: the good
    color for allies, bad color for foes, neutral color for truces, trades,
    independent and un-colonized planets.</li>
  <li><b>Ship coloring by diplomatic status:</b> when this option is selected,
    the per-planet ship counts on the map screen will be colored according to
    the lowest respective diplomacy level with the viewing empire of all empires
    who have ships at the planet. If that level is war, then the color will be <a href="#Color">bad</a>.&nbsp;
    If the level is alliance then it will be <a href="#Color">good</a>.
    Otherwise, it will be the standard text color chosen by the empire.</li>
  <li><b>Ship highlighting on map screen:</b> when this option is selected, the
    ship totals on each planet will be displayed with a larger font and in
    boldface, if the total is greater than zero.</li>
  <li><b>Partial maps:</b> when this option is selected, the <a href="#Map">Map</a>
    screen will
    display a menu at the top allowing the player to choose the center of the
    map that should be displayed, as well as its X and Y radius. This allows
    players in games with very large maps to reduce the size of the <a href="#Map">Map</a>
    screen, which is useful for users with slow connections, old computers or <a href="http://www.webtv.com/">WebTV</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Display ship menus in planet views: </b> this option allows players to
    select if ship menus should be displayed in the <a href="#Planets">Planets</a> 
    and <a href="#Map">Map</a>  screens.</li>
  <li><b>Display local maps in up-close map views:</b> when this option is
    selected, up-close views on the <a href="#Map">Map</a> screen will contain a
    small local (3x3) map centered around the specific selected planet. This map
    is interactive and can be clicked on to obtain up-close views of the
    surrounding planets.</li>
  <li><b>Default builder planet:</b> this option allows players to select which
    planet will be the default builder planet on the <a href="#Build">Build</a>
    screen. Options include the player's empire's homeworld, the last planet used
    to build or a specific planet owned by the empire.</li>
  <li><b>Default message target:</b> this option allows players to select what

<p>The Next Pop field represents the system's prediction of how much population
will be at a planet the next update. This doesn't take into account factors that
cannot be easily predicted, such as ship combat results. As a security measure,
neither the Max Pop or the Next Pop fields of another empire's planets can be
viewed.</p>
<p>The Max Pop field represents a maximum on the population the planet can have. 
There is usually no reason to waste resources on maintaining more population on 
a planet than its mineral and fuel units, unless the planet is meant to be a 
builder of ships and is below the building limit. If the Max Pop field is set to 
zero, then the planet can be colonized by other empires, allies or foes alike.</p>
<p>If a planet is quarantined, the up-close view will display the number of

<p>&quot;They offer&quot; is the diplomatic level currently being offered by the
empire in question to the player's empire. &quot;You offer&quot; is the
diplomatic level currently being offered by the player's empire to the other
empire. The &quot;status&quot; is the current diplomatic level between the two,
which is the level at which agreement has been reached. That level is always the
lower of the two offered.</p>
<p>Diplomatic levels are discussed in <a href="#Diplomatic">section 3.5.1</a>.</p>
<p>The &quot;IP Address&quot; is a hashed version of the player's real IP. It
can be used to determine if two empires are being manipulated by same empire (or
at least from the same machine). The &quot;last access&quot; field displays the
amount of time that has passed since the player last requested a screen in the
current game.</p>
<p>The &quot;Econ&quot; level is an expression of the empire's economic
well-being. It is obtained by the following formula:</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Econ = floor ((Fuel + Min + Ag) / 100)</font></p>
<p>The &quot;Mil&quot; level is an expression of the empire's current military
strength. It is obtained by the following formula:</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Mil = floor (sum (all ship's BR's squared) / 50)</font></p>
<p>Both the econ and mil levels are only changed during updates, so the effects
on these totals of ship builds or dismantles will only be seen after the
subsequent update.</p>
<p>The &quot;Pause&quot; field is set to &quot;Yes&quot; if the empire has
requested a paused game. Games are paused when all empires unanimously agree to
request a pause, after which the game's update timer will stop until at least
one of the players is no longer requesting a pause. This allows all players in a
game to put the game's resolution off until a future date. Paused games can 
still update, if all empires have ended their turn.</p>
<p>A game can only be paused when it has closed. This solves the potential
problem of empires agreeing to pause a game and then being helpless at the hands
of a newcomer who is not requesting pause.</p>
<p>When an empire becomes idle, it will automatically request a pause if there is still at least one empire in the game who is not idle. This allows
games with idle empires to be paused, while preventing games with all empires
idle from remaining alive on the server forever in a paused state.</p>
<p>The <b>Hear</b>/<b>Ignore</b> option allows the player to decide whether or
not he or she wants to view the private messages and broadcasts coming from the
other empire.</p>
<p>The Diplomacy screen displays information at the top of the screen about
the visibility of diplomatic settings, diplomacy restrictions, and the number of
empires requesting a pause in the game.</p>
<p>Messages to other empires can be also sent from the Diplomacy screen.
Messages can either be broadcast to all, or sent as private messages. The option
also exists to send messages to all empires who are at a given diplomatic status
with the empire.</p>
<h2><a name="Diplomatic">3.5.1 Diplomatic levels</a></h2>
<p>There are five separate diplomatic levels:
<ul>
  <li><strong>War</strong>: if two empires are at war, then their ships will
    fight and destroy each other whenever they encounter on another. It also
    enables their ships to nuke each other's planets and obliterate each other's
    home worlds.</li>
  <li><strong>Truce</strong>: if two empires are at truce, then their ships will
    not attack one another and they cannot nuke one another's planets. There are
    no other benefits from this setting.</li>
  <li><strong>Trade</strong>: if two empires are at trade, then they are at
    truce and they receive additional economic benefits: 10% of their resource
    totals for the first trade partner, and a certain percentage of that for
    each additional partner.</li>
  <li><strong>Alliance</strong>: if a group of empires are at alliance with one
    another, then they receive the benefits of trade, in addition to which they
    can win games when no other empires remain.</li>
  <li><strong>Draw</strong>: if a group of empires are at draw with one another,
    then they can draw games when no other empires remain.</li>
  <li><strong>Surrender</strong>: if an empire offers surrender to another
    empire and is accepted, then the result is equivalent to the latter nuking
    the former.</li>
  <li><strong>Accept Surrender</strong>: this option accepts an offered
    surrender.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for a coalition of allied empires win a game, they all
need to be allied with one another. In other words, <em>n! </em>alliances are
needed, where <em>n</em> is the number of empires.</p>
<p>It is important to note that draw, surrender and accept surrender are not
diplomatic status settings. For example, if two empires are at war, but are
offering each other draw, they will still remain at war.</p>
<p>Diplomatic levels are only known to the empires in question, although their
effects are visible by all: noticeably increased economic levels in some cases,
ships not engaging in combat in others. It should be considered good ethical
practice to disclose details of alliances to other empires, as this leads to
more &quot;fair&quot; and balanced games, but there is no obligation to do so.
The non-disclosure of an alliance might in certain circumstances lead to
advantageous positions for the empires engaging in a secret agreement, so
private double-crossings can never be ruled out.</p>
<p>An interesting observation is that alliances can be broken at any time. One
can never rest easily on one's laurels because at any moment one's allies may
move over to the other side. Trust is always a matter of game circumstances and
of convenience, never a permanent asset.</p>
<p>At one point, the idea of locking empires into alliances was considered, but
it appeared to remove an element of interest and tension from the game. Monogamy
may make for a healthy society, but polygamy is  more rewarding from a selfish, 
individual perspective.</p>
<p>Although one might think that with rules like these, anarchy would soon reign
in every game (as it does in other online games or communities with lax rules,
such as <em>Ultima Online</em>), it should be remembered that double-crossing
players will be remembered by their victims and their actions will perhaps even
be disclosed and discussed publicly. Subsequent games will be harder for the
double-crosser, because his empire name will be viewed with suspicion and only
the naive will ally with him. Empires who wish to be well-known in the community
will probably find themselves behaving honorably in most cases.</p>
<p>Because every game begins with the galaxy's resources distributed more or
less equally among all empires, there is no real incentive to constantly sack
and pillage one's allies (as there might be in <em>Ultima Online</em>, where
rewards are more or less permanent). Consequently, the short-term gain that can
be obtained from double-crossing is balanced out by the long-term damage.
Because games of this type encourage role-playing, it seems likely that both
well-known honorable empires and shady, double-crossing empires will co-exist,
perhaps even within the control of the same human player.</p>
<p>All things considered, it appears that this situation is of benefit to the game, and not
a drawback.</p>

level than their potential maximum. This circumstance can be understood as the

will perform exactly the same action. Fleets are very useful when an empire has
a large number of ships performing the same action, such as moving towards an
enemy empire's homeworld.</p>
<h2><a name="Color">3.6.2 Color coding</a></h2>
<p>In the various <em>Almonaster</em> game screens, the observant player will
notice that some values are coded <font color="#00FF00">green</font>, some <font color="#FFFFFF">white</font>
and some the standard yellow. There is a reason for this.
<ul>
  <li><strong><font color="#00FF00">Good</font></strong> colors represent values
    that are good for an empire. For example, in the table displayed above, the
    ships are at full strength (that is, their BR is equal to their Max BR).
    Similarly, in the <a href="#Planets"> Planets</a> screen, high resource totals will use <font color="#00FF00">good</font>
    text.</li>
  <li><b>Normal</b> colors represent values that are factual or average, neither
    good nor bad.</li>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Bad</b></font> colors represent values that are
    negative for an empire. In this case of the Ships screen, the Next BR values
    displayed above are below the Max BR and therefore represent a non-optimal
    situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This scheme extends itself to such aspects as <a href="#Diplomatic">diplomatic
settings</a>. For example, allied empires will be represented in <font color="#00FF00">good</font>
colors, while warring empires will be in bad <font color="#FFFFFF">colors</font>.
Map coloring will also use these schemes to represent planets belonging to
empires at various diplomatic levels.</p>
<p>The actual colors used to represent good and bad colors are selected by the
empire's graphical theme.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The number is the number of ships of a given type that will be built.</li>
  <li>The name is the name that all the ships of a given type will receive. This
    name defaults to the values specified by the empire in its <a href="#ProfileEditor">Profile
    Editor</a>.</li>
  <li>The BR is the Max BR at which ships of a given type will be built. More
    powerful ships are more costly, so sometimes it makes sense to build less
    powerful ships for certain situations.</li>
  <li>The location is the planet upon which the ships will be built. Planets
    must have a certain population level in order to build ships; this level is
    defined by the game class.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a fleet is created, it starts out with no ships. These can either join
the fleet via the <a href="#Ships">Ships</a> screen or they can be built into
the fleet via the location drop-down menu, which will include this option if a
fleet is located on a builder planet.</p>
<p>The Build screen also displays information at the top of the screen about
whether builds are visible or invisible in the game.</p>
<h2><a name="Tech">3.8 The Tech screen</a></h2>
<p>The Tech screen allows empires to choose new <a href="#ShipTypes">ship types</a>
that can then be <a href="#Build">built</a>. New technologies can be developed
when new BR levels are reached.</p>
<h2><a name="Quit">3.9 The Quit button</a></h2>
<p>The quit button is only available to an player when the game that he or she
is in has not yet started. It allows empires to cleanly quit from a game without
being given a loss or a nuke.</p>
<h2><a name="ExitGame">3.10 The Exit button</a></h2>
<p>The exit button allows a player to leave the current game that he or she is
in and join another game or edit his or her empire's profile, without actually
quitting the empire from the first game.</p>
<h2><a name="Ruins">3.11 Ruins</a></h2>
<p>If all empires in a game are idle, then they will all fall into ruin and the
game will end.</p>
<p>If a game has simple ruins enabled, it will behave just like classic <i> Stellar
Crisis</i>: any empire that has been idle for a gameclass-specific number of updates will fall into ruin and be removed from the game.</p>
<p>If a game has complex ruins enabled, then ruins can only occur if all empires except one are idle for a gameclass-specific number of
updates. In this case, the idle empires will only fall into ruin if more than two empires were in the game at some point during its lifetime.</p>
<p>When an empire falls into ruin, it is removed from the game as if it had been
obliterated, and its <i>Almonaster
</i>score is modified as if an empire with identical statistics had
nuked it. The Classic Score cost of a ruin is by default -1.0. Empires who win
games in which other empires fall into ruin will not gain any credit for their
elimination.</p>
<h2><a name="Surrenders">3.12 Surrenders</a></h2>
<p>In <i>Almonaster</i> games in which the Surrender option is enabled, an empire can surrender to another empire at
any moment after the game has started. In order to surrender,&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The recipient empire must be at war with the surrendering empire.</li>
  <li>The recipient empire must never have been allied with the surrendering
    empire.</li>
  <li>The recipient empire must accepts
the surrender.</li>
</ul>
<p>The surrendering empire is considered to be nuked by the recipient empire in
terms of all relevant statistics and scores. When an empire surrenders, its homeworld's resources are reduced by one
half, as if the planet had been nuked (note that if an empire's homeworld is
annhilated with a doomsday, invaded with a troopship or colonized, its resources
are not halved).</p>
<p>In games where classic SC-style surrenders are enabled, any empire can
surrender at any time by using the button located in the <a href="#Options">Options</a>
screen. Surrendering empires receive a <i>nuked </i>and are
removed from the game. Their homeworlds are labeled &quot;Ruins of &lt;empire
name&gt;&quot;, and when colonized they give their colonizers a <i> nuke</i>
(which counts in all scores). If a surrendered homeworld is not colonized before
the game ends, then
there are two possible scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the game ends, only one empire remains: in this case the survivor is considered to have
    nuked the owner of the surrendered empire.</li>
  <li>When the game ends, more than one empire remains: in this case no one gets a <i>nuke</i>,
    but the winners receive an increase to their <i>Almonaster</i> scores
    proportional&nbsp; to the amount they would have obtained had they nuked the
    surrendered empire themselves. Similarly, the surrendered empire loses an
    amount of <i>Almonaster</i> score points equivalent to the average of the
    amount it would have lost had it been nuked individually by each of the
    survivors.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Randomization">3.13 Randomization</a></h2>
<p>The following actions in <i>Almonaster</i>  game play are randomized:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The order of empire addition to map during map generation</li>
  <li>The order of empire processing during an update</li>
  <li>The order of ship movement processing during an update</li>
  <li>The order of ship special action and nuke processing during an update</li>
  <li>The order of gates processed during an update</li>
  <li>The order of diplomacy resolutions during an update</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Independence">3.14 Independence</a></h2>
<p>If independence is enabled for a particular game, when an empire is nuked its
surviving planets remain alive and populated as so-called independent planets,
and they cannot simply be re-colonized by other empires. Since they have a life
of their own, they must be nuked or invaded in order to be used by other
empires. The population of an independent planet will grow or shrink according
to the amount of agricultural units the planet possesses. Planets with zero
agriculture units will not become independent.</p>
<p>In a game with independence enabled, a dead empire's ships may either
disappear, remain independent, or revert to the ownership of the empire who owns
of the planet at which the ships were located. The logic is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the ship is a cloaker, it uncloaks.</li>
  <li>If the planet a ship is on is unpopulated, the ship will disappear, unless
    it's a colony, in which case it will attempt to colonize it.</li>
  <li>If the planet a ship is on is independent, the ship remains alive as an
    independent ship, and its BR never changes.</li>
  <li>If the planet a ship is on belongs to an empire, the ship reverts to the 
  ownership of that empire, regardless of the latter's tech developments. 
  Empires do have the right to reject such independent ship gifts - this can be 
  configured via the <a href="#ProfileEditor">Profile Editor</a> and
  <a href="#Options">Options</a> screens.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Etiquette">3.15 Etiquette</a></h2>
<p><i>Almonaster</i> game playing etiquette does not differ greatly from basic <i>Stellar
Crisis </i>etiquette. Erick Beck's <a href="http://members.xoom.com/ebeck/sc/etiq.htm">Guide
to Stellar Crisis Etiquette</a> provides an excellent summary of the latter.
There are several things I would add, however:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Communication is a fundamental part of the game, especially in the case of
    alliances. Many players will ally
    with someone and not inform them of their ship movements or overall
    strategy. This is a mistake.</li>
  <li>In <i>Almonaster</i>, HTML abuse is not a problem, and the ignore option
    in the <a href="#Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> screen can be used to filter out
    messages from undesirable empires.</li>
  <li>The game is intended to be fun. Winning, acquiring nukes and incrementing
    one's scores is only a small part of the game. The larger part is enjoyment,
    both one's own and that of others. This should be one's guiding factor when
    deciding how to behave and which persona to adopt while playing. So feel
    free to send
    lots of messages, joke around, use funny empire names, upload humorous icons
    and have a good time.&nbsp; But don't let it upset you when you get nuked until you
    glow. It's just a game.</li>
  <li>Don't just leave a game, even if you're losing. Many players will just
    stop playing when they know they've lost, which costs the other players a
    few updates' worth of time before the game ends. The best way for the losing
    player to resolve this situation is to go to the <a href="#Options">Options </a>screen
    and resign.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Browsers">3.16 Web Browser Compatibility</a></h2>
<p><em>Aljar </em>and <i>Almonaster</i> have been tested mostly with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/">Internet
Explorer 5.0</a> and later versions. Some secondary testing has been done with the latest
&quot;classic&quot; versions of <a href="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/">Netscape</a>,
which at the time of this writing is at 4.76. <a href="http://www.operasoftware.com/">Opera
4.0</a> has also been tested successfully. None of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>-based
browsers have been tested, although one would expect them to be better than the
4.x versions of Netscape.</p>
<p>Known problems with browsers include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some older versions of Opera, including 3.61, would hang waiting for
    images to download. This has apparently been fixed in Opera 4.0.</li>
  <li>Some versions of classic Netscape have the bad habit of fetching the
    results of a form submission from the browser cache, which obviously won't
    work well with <i>Almonaster</i>. This has apparently been fixed in 4.73,
    but a workaround is to go to Edit / Preferences / Advanced / Cache and set
    &quot;Document in cache is compared to document on network&quot; to
    &quot;Every time&quot;. This issue is probably related to the icon upload
    problems some people have been seeing with this browser.</li>

<h2><a name="Advanced"><b>4.0 Advanced Topics</b></a></h2>
<p>This section discusses several topics that users will need to understand in
order to become quality <em>Almonaster</em> players. However, novice players
will have some difficulty understanding them until they acquire more experience.</p>
<h2><a name="ShipCombat">4.1 Ship combat</a></h2>
<p>The formula that decides ship combat is rather complex. A high level overview
of the combat sequence can be expressed as follows:
<ol>
  <li>For each set of ships involved in combat (where each empire owns a set),
    two numbers are calculated:<br>
    a) The sum of the ship set's combat points, where the combat points for each
    ship are calculated by squaring its current BR.<br>
    b) The sum of all the opposing ship sets' combat points.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The damage done to one empire's ships by another empire's ships is a
    percentage of the latter's combat points. This percentage is calculated by
    dividing the former's combat points by the total number of enemy combat
    points attacking the latter. In other words, empire A will attack empire B
    in direct proportion to the significance of empire B in the set of empires
    that are attacking empire A.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Ships are destroyed until the opposing empire's combat points no longer
    suffice to destroy any ships. At this point, damage is distributed equally
    among the remaining ships. The math works out so that no opposing factions
    can remain at the end of combat. The strongest faction always wins. The only
    randomization in the algorithm is in the part that decides which ships are
    destroyed.</li>
  <li>If at any point a ship's BR falls below 0.001, it will be automatically 
  dismantled.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="ShipCombat2">4.1.1 Ship combat details</a></h2>
<p>Almonaster ship combat follows the <i>Stellar Crisis </i>combat resolution
algorithm in all but two details:</p>
<p>From the <em>Stellar Crisis</em> FAQ:</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Combat takes place between warring ships in the same
system. Combat is resolved in the following manner:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Preliminary calculations:</font>
<dl>
  <dt><font face="Arial">Each empire determines their Battle Points.</font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Arial">BP = (sum of the squares of the current BR's of you
    ships) * (fuel use ratio (if less then one))</font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Arial">A list of all of the empires you are at war with is
    then made, call it enemy_list.</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">All of the BP's from those empires on the enemy_list
    are totaled together, call it enemy_BP_tot.</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">For each empire in the enemy_list, determine the
    percentage of enemy_BP_tot that their BP represents, and assign a similar
    percentage of your BP (call this %_DMG) to their ships' total damage
    sustained (TOT_DMG).</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">After this is done for every empire, everyone will have
    a TOT_DMG.</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">Combat resolution:</font></dt>
  <p><font face="Arial">The TOT_DMG is then cut in half. One half of which, is
  the destruction value for that empire (DEST). The other half of TOT_DMG is the
  secondary damage value (2DV).</font></p>
  <dt><font face="Arial">The DEST is then checked against the square of a ship's
    current BR. If DEST is higher then this then the ship is destroyed.
    (subtracting the BP of that ship from DEST) This is continued until either
    the DEST is two small to destroy any more ships, or there are no more ships.</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">The remaining DEST is then added back onto the 2DV.
    This is then used to check every ship once again to see if it is destroyed
    from secondary fire. This can result in destruction of all your remaining
    ships, of course.</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">the current_BP for your ship is then determined.</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">Then your opponent's 2DV is divided by your current_BP
    to determine the amount of damage sustained by your ships.</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">Damage Ratio= Opponents 2DV/ Your current_BP</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">Empires with Damage Ratios above one, have their entire
    fleet destroyed.</font></dt>
  <dt><font face="Arial">The current BR for the surviving ships is determined
    by:</font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Arial">Current BR = (1-damage ratio) * Initial BR&quot;</font></dd>
</dl>
<p>The first difference is that in <i>Almonaster</i>, the percentage of TOT_DMG
that is converted to DEST can be configured by the administrator, while in
classic <i>Stellar
Crisis</i> it is always set to 50%.</p>
<p>The second difference is that if an empire's fuel ratio is below 1.0, <i>Almonaster</i>
 also multiplies each ship's individual BP by its owner's fuel ratio when calculating the damage
done to the ship, while classic <i>Stellar Crisis</i> only applies the
fuel ratio to each empire's total BP. In other words, a BR 2.0 ship with a 0.75 fuel
ratio can be destroyed with 2.0 * 2.0 * 0.75&nbsp; = 3.0 DEST points. The advantage of the <i>Almonaster</i> approach
is that if two full strength ships of equal BR and sub-1.0 fuel ratios
collide, at least one will be destroyed, while in <i>Stellar Crisis</i>
both may remain alive.</p>
<h2><a name="OverBuild">4.2 Overbuilding</a></h2>
<p>Most beginning players who have begun to master the basics of ship deployment
will be careful to keep their maintenance ratios above 1.0, in order to keep
their ships prepared for combat. However, players using this strategy will soon
find their ships overwhelmed by larger fleets belonging to more experienced
players, created in the blink of an eye to the surprise of the beginners. This
happens because experienced players know about overbuilding and are capable of
taking advantage of the mathematics of the game.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind overbuilding is simple:&nbsp; if an empire builds a
fleet with enough ships to send its maintenance ratio below 1.0, during the next
update all ships belonging to that empire will be very weak and will be easily
defeated in combat by inferior forces. However, given an update or two to
recover, that fleet will recover its full strength and will be large enough to
be capable of defeating fleets that were built with more conservative
maintenance ratios.</p>
<p>Some players will overbuild fleets that take two or even three updates to
recover, but usually only in desperate situations, since the technological cost
of building such large fleets is usually very high.</p>
<p>The <strong>Next Maintenance Ratio</strong> can be used to calculate the
strength of a fleet in two updates, and is therefore a most valuable tool for
the eager overbuilder.</p>
<h2><a name="PopTrick">4.3 The Pop Trick</a></h2>
<p>Another observation that newer players will make when confronted with grzzled
veterans is the facility of the latter to take advantage of a moment's lull in
hostilities to manipulate the population on their planets. While the beginner's
planets will slowly grow from their original population of colonists to full
builder status, the experienced player will be able to build at his or her
frontier planets in a mere couple of updates, and will therefore have a large
advantage in the subsequent war.</p>
<p>The reason this is possible is again due to the mathematics of the game.
Given the way the Ag Ratio is calculated (essentially Total Agriculture
divided by Total Population), the savvy player can manipulate his or her
planets' populations so that in a subsequent update the Agriculture Ratio will
be very large and by the next update the planets' populations will be greatly
increased. This procedure is known as the <strong>pop trick</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, an empire has three planets with the following characteristics:
<ol>
  <li>100 agriculture, 100 population</li>
  <li>60 agriculture, 5 population</li>
  <li>20 agriculture, 16 population</li>
</ol>
<p>A successful pop trick at this stage will look like this:
<ol>
  <li>Set the planets' maximum populations to 4, 2, 1 respectively.</li>
  <li>End turn: after the update the planets' populations will be 4, 2, 1,
    respectively. The ag ratio will be 180 / 7 = 25.714</li>
  <li>Set the planets' maximum populations to 100, 50, 20, respectively.</li>
  <li>End turn: after the update, the planets' populations will be 100, 50 and
    20, respectively</li>
</ol>
<p>The risk here is that during the update in which the planets' populations are
low, the empire cannot have any ships alive, or its tech increase will become
heavily negative because it will not have any minerals available for
maintenance. Consequently, the empire will be tremendously vulnerable to a stray
science ship or a well-placed cloaker.</p>
<p>Therefore, experienced players know when the best time to trick is, but even
they can be burned sometimes. The pop trick can be risky, but it brings great
advantages when used successfully.
<h2><a name="CustomGETs">4.4 Custom GETs</a></h2>
<p>It is possible for players to get screens from an <i>Almonaster </i>server
without passing through the login screen. This can be done by submitting a GET
request with the following URI:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">/page source name/?EmpireName=X&amp;ClearTextPassword=Y&amp;PageId=Z</font></p>
<p>where X is the empire's name, Y is its password and Z is the desired page id.</p>
<p>In a regular web browser, an example URL to submit would look like this:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">http://mfeingol1.olywa.net/?EmpireName=Destroyer&amp;ClearTextPassword=ofplanets10&amp;PageId=4</font></p>
<p>The page ids that can be requested are the following:</p>

<h2><a name="SessionIds">4.5 Session Ids</a></h2>
<p>Each empire on an Almonaster server is assigned a 64-bit integer called a
Session Id, which is stored in the server's database. Session Ids are used for
game screen <a href="#PasswordHashing">password hashing</a> and optional multi-emping
security measures. A Session Id is also stored on a player's hard drive as a
cookie, so it is common for multiple empires owned by one player to use the same
Session Id. When the Session Id in the cookie conflicts with the Session Id
stored in the database, the version stored in the cookie wins and overwrites the
version stored in the database.</p>
<h2><a name="PasswordHashing">4.6 Password hashing</a></h2>
<p>Frequently players find themselves wanting to save game screens, especially
maps, in order to document a game or show off their nuking prowess. In most
versions of <i>Stellar Crisis</i>, it is necessary to remove the password field
from the HTML text before making it public, because the value could be used by
other players to hack into the empire used to generate the screen.</p>
<p><i>Almonaster</i> solves this problem by using the player's IP address and <a href="#SessionIds">session
id</a> to provide uniqueness to the password hash. This additional security can
be configured by selecting the respective options in the <a href="#ProfileEditor">Profile
Editor</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="EmpireAdmin">5.2 The Empire Administrator screen</a></h2>
<p>This screen allows an administrator perform advanced searches for empires,
based upon various criteria. The chosen fields will be AND'ed together, which
means that a search with multiple fields selected is understood as a query of
the type &quot;list all empires whose names contain the letter 'w' and whose
email addresses contain the string 'cornell.edu' and who have between 3 and 6
wins&quot;.
<p>The administrator can perform the following actions upon an empire:
<ul>
  <li>Change their privilege levels, passwords and scores</li>
  <li>
    <p>Toggle their broadcast privilege</li>
  <li>
    <p>Obliterate them: obliterated empires are removed from any games they are
    participating in and deleted from the server</li>
</ul>
<p>The Empire Administrator screen also allows administrators to broadcast a
message to all empires on the server.
<h2><a name="GameAdmin">5.3 The Game Administrator screen</a></h2>
<p>This screen allows an administrator to perform the following tasks:
<ul>
  <li>Create, rename and delete superclasses</li>
  <li>Create, delete and halt gameclasses</li>
  <li>Change the default limits on system and personal gameclass characteristics</li>
  <li>View and modify all active games (pause, delete, send messages, force 
  updates, restore resigned empires, remove empires, etc.)</li>
  <li>Change server-wide game settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the settings in the Game Administrator screen are self-explanatory.&nbsp; 
Some aren't:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Percent of damage used to destroy (DEST)</b> is the percentage of TOT_DMG is
    converted to DEST during ship combat (see <a href="#ShipCombat2">section
    4.11</a> for more details on this). In&nbsp; a nutshell, the larger this 
  value, the larger the percentage of ships destroyed during combat, and the 
  higher the BR of the surviving ships.</li>
  <li><b>Percent econ increase on first trade</b> is the percent increase in an 
  empire's econ when a first trade agreement is established.</li>
  <li><b>Percent of previous econ increase on next trade</b> is the percent of
    the previous increase in an empire's econ when a trade agreement is
    established that should be used to calculate the next increase. For example,
    if the first increase was 10% and this number is 90%, then the second trade
    agreement will give an 9% increase, the third 8.1%, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Percent of full tech increase for late entrances</b> is the percentage of the
    maximum possible tech increase given to latecomers in a game. The maximum 
  possible tech increase is the maximum tech development for an update 
  multiplied by the number of updates the new empire missed.</li>
  <li><b>Number of nukes before planet is quarantined</b> is the number of nukes 
  it takes for a
    planet to become temporarily annihilated. After this number is reached, any 
  subsequent nuke will result in an immediate period of quarantine.</li>
  <li><b>Number of updates in quarantine after planet is nuked</b> is the number of
    updates a planet will be in quarantine after it is nuked the requisite 
  amount of
    times.</li>
  <li><b>Update delay after a weekend for non-weekend-update games</b> is the time added to the weekend update periods
    of non-weekend update games. This period is added to avoid premature updates 
  in these games. Most servers have clients log in from all possible time zones, 
  and not everyone's schedule matches the server's.</li>
  <li><b>Maximum number of updates before games close</b> is the value used to 
  make sure that games close after a reasonable period.&nbsp; Because open games 
  cannot end, games with unreasonably large values for this setting can consume 
  server resources unnecessarily. This value provides a cap on such resource 
  usage.</li>
  <li><b>Colony behavior</b> determines the population cost of a colony ship, as 
  well as the number of colonists it will deposit. Build costs can be either 
  simple (a fixed value) or multiplied (a fixed value times the ship's BR), 
  while population deposit can be either multiplied (a fixed value times the 
  ship's BR) or exponential (the ship's BR to a fixed power).</li>
  <li><b>Gate range factors</b> are values that, if range limitations are 
  enabled, determine how far a given gate (be it stargate or jumpgate) can send 
  a ship. The range factor multiplied a given planet distance to give the BR of 
  the gate needed to reach it. The distance between two planets is the greater 
  of the differences between their X coordinates and their Y coordinates.&nbsp; 
  (E.g., the distance between Planet 3,4 and Planet 7,16 is 12. With a range 
  factor of 0.5, a BR6 stargate is required to gate between the two.)</li>
  <li><b>Terraformer agriculture multiplier</b> is the factor that multiplies a terraformer's BR to determine the agriculture increase 
  that it will provide when terraforming
    a planet. This value is capped by the maximum of the fuel and minerals 
  available to the planet.</li>
  <li><b>Troopship invasion multiplier</b> is the factor that multiplies a 
  troopship's BR to determine the planetary population it can successfully 
  invade.</li>
  <li><b>Troopship failure factor</b> is the factor that multiplies a 
  troopship's BR to determine the planetary population it will kill when an 
  invasion fails.</li>
  <li><b>Troopship success factor</b> is the factor that multiplies
    a planetary population to determine how many units are killed when an
    invasion is successful.</li>
  <li><b>Doomsday annihilation multiplier</b> is the factor that multiplies a 
  doomsday's BR to determine the number of updates a planet it annihilates will 
  remain in quarantine.</li>
  <li><b>Carrier battle cost</b> is the BR a carrier will lose after engaging in 
  a battle in which its special DEST absorption abilities are used. Carriers 
  absorb the square of their BR in DEST when targeted for DEST damage, but are 
  otherwise unaffected, aside from their battle cost.&nbsp; (See <a href="#ShipCombat2">section
    4.11</a> for more details on what DEST is.)</li>
  <li><b>Builder minimum BR </b>is the minimum BR needed for a builder to be 
  able to create a planet. Planets created by builders with BRs above this 
  minumum will be allocated resource totals according to the following formula:
    1.5 * (average planet for game) * ((BR - BuilderMinBR + 1) / BR)^2</li>
  <li><b>Morpher morphing cost</b> is the BR cost of changing a morpher from one 
  ship type to another. Morphers change shape early in the update, before ship 
  combat occurs.</li>
  <li><b>Compatibility flags </b>are options provided for the sake of 
  classicists that enable server owners to disable ship behavior present in <i>
  Almonaster</i> but not in classic <i>Stellar Crisis</i>.</li>
  <li><b>Percent chance a planet will be a linked to an adjacent planet</b> is the percent chance that a new link
    will form after a new planet is created next to an old planet that it was not
    initially linked to. This defines the degree of 'connectedness' of maps.</li>
  <li><b>Resource allocation deviation multiplier</b> is the factor that
    multiplies the average amount or resources in a planet and determines the
    approximate maximum number of resources available to a planet. For example, if
    average agriculture value is 30, and the deviation multiplier is 6, then a planet can have up to 30 * 6 =
    180 units of agriculture, minerals or fuel. In a nutshell, the greater this value, the greater the
    disparity between the resources allocated to different planets.</li>
  <li><b>Maximum map deviation</b> is the number that places a maximum on the 
  random deviation of
    the first planet from the center X, Y coordinate. This is important because 
  if this value is small sometimes empires can use the coordinates of their 
  homeworld to determine their location and the probable direction of their foes 
  even before exploring their map.</li>
  <li><b>Percent chance a new planet will be linked to the last created planet 
  (large map)</b> is the percent
    chance that, when generating a map, a new planet will be linked to the last
    created planet, instead of a random planet in the new chain. This value 
  applies to large maps.</li>
  <li><b>Percent chance a new planet will be linked to the last created planet 
  (small map)</b>&nbsp;is the same value applied to small maps. These two values 
  determine how spread out the map will be, how many planetary chains will form 
  and how much empty space will appear between clusters of planets. In general, 
  the larger these percentages, the larger the chance of planetary chains 
  forming.</li>
  <li><b>Large map threshold</b> is the number of planets per empire required 
  for a map
    
    to be considered &quot;large&quot;.</li>

        multiple threads simultaneously, Single if only one thread should access
        the page source code at the same time.</li>
      <li><strong>DenyAccess</strong> is a list of IP addresses that should be
        blocked from the web server. Any request coming from these addresses
        will receive a 403 HTTP error message. The IP addresses should be
        separated by semicolons, and can use * as a wildcard parameter. For
        example, <strong>DenyAccess</strong>=127*;192*; will deny access to all
        those addresses beginning with 127 and 192. The wildcard terminates
        parsing, so 127.*.0.1 will block 127.0.0.2 also.</li>
      <li><strong>OnlyAllowAccess </strong>specifies a list of IP addresses that
        are granted access to the server to the exclusion of all others. <strong>OnlyAllowAccess</strong>
        overrides <strong>DenyAccess</strong>, so any excluded addresses in the <strong>DenyAccess</strong>
        list will be ignored. The syntax for <strong>OnlyAllowAccess </strong>is
        the same as for <strong>DenyAccess</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

</ul>
<p>The <em>Almonaster</em> page source adds the following parameters to its page
source configuration file:
<ul>
  <li><strong>DatabaseName</strong> is the path to be used for the main <em>Almonaster
    </em>database</li>
  <li><strong>ResourceDirectory</strong> is the directory where system resources
    are kept. This directory must be placed below the <strong>BasePath</strong>.</li>
  <li><b>DelayTableLoads</b> is 1 if database tables should only be loaded on
    demand; 0 if they should all be preloaded by the database.</li>
  <li><strong>ChatroomMaxNumSpeakers</strong> is the maximum number of
    simultaneous speakers allowed in the chatroom</li>
  <li><strong>ChatroomNumMessages</strong> is the number of messages kept in the
    chatroom's message buffer</li>
  <li><b>ChatroomMaxMessageLength</b> is the length that long chatroom messages
    will be truncated to.</li>
  <li><strong>ChatroomTimeOut</strong> is the number of seconds a speaker may
    remain in the database without refreshing the screen or posting a message</li>
  <li><strong>AutoBackup </strong>is 1 if the system should be scheduled to
    automatically backup the database, 0 if not</li>
  <li><strong>NumHoursBetweenBackups</strong> is an integer value that
    represents the number of hours between database backups</li>
  <li><strong>BackupLifeTime</strong> is the number of days that backups will be 
  left alive before they are deleted by the system. This option is only 
  meaningful if <strong>AutoBackup</strong> is 1.</li>
  <li><b>BackupOnStartup</b> is 1 if the server should
    create a database backup at startup. This option is only meaningful if <strong>AutoBackup</strong> is 1.</li>
  <li><strong>ReportLoginEvents</strong> is 1 if login attempts (successes and
    failures) should be logged to the report file, 0 if not</li>
  <li><strong>ReportGameEndings </strong>is 1 if game endings should be logged

    not</li>
  <li><b>HookLibrary</b> is the name of a DLL that is loaded by the game engine 
  and called at standard times during setup and finalization. It exists to 
  provide special functionality such as pre-initialization database scripts.</li>
  <li><b>RebuildTopListsOnStartup </b>is 1 if the server should regenerate its
    top lists from scratch at startup, 0 if not</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the server has been configured properly, <em>Aljar</em> can be run
from the command line. <font size="3">After this, connecting to <em><a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>
</em>or <em><a href="http://127.0.0.1/">http://127.0.0.1/</a> </em>in any web
browser should bring up the <i>Almonaster</i> login screen.</font> To shut down
the server<font size="3">, log into <a href="http://localhost/admin/">http://localhost/admin/</a>
with the username and password from admin.conf, or hit ctrl-c in </font><em>Aljar</em>'s<font size="3">
console window.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The default empire with administrative privileges is:<br>
Login:&nbsp; root<br>
Password:&nbsp; neil:young</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The default guest empire for read only access to the Open Game
list:<br>
Login:&nbsp; guest<br>
Password:&nbsp; crazy:horse</font></p>
<p>The text displayed on the server's login screen can be customized by editing
the following two files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Www_root\Almonaster\Resource\Text\Intro.html</b> contains the text
    printed between the <i>Almonaster</i> logo and the upper separator bar on
    the login screen.</li>
  <li><b>Www_root\Almonaster\Resource\Text\Intro-Upper.html </b>contains the
    text printed between the upper separator bar and the login forms.</li>
  <li><b>Www_root\Almonaster\Resource\Text\Intro-Lower.html </b>contains the
    text that is printed between the login forms and the lower separator bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter two files can be updated via the Server Administrator page when
the server is active.</p>
<h2><a name="Database">5.6 The Almonaster database</a></h2>
<p>The Almonaster database in version 2.1 is a clean re-write from previous
versions. It lives on disk under the directory given in the Almonaster .conf
file, under which it creates two separate directories:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Data:</b> this directory stores the actual data in the database. Each
    directory under this one corresponds to a given table template or
    description of a particular table format, stored in a <i>template.dat</i>
    file. The directories under each template directory correspond to the tables
    that have been created to obey that particular template. The data in each
    table is stored in a <i>Table.dat </i>file.</li>
  <li><b>Backups: </b>this directory contains all backups made by the database
    at the request of its clients.</li>
</ol>
<p>The contents of a database should never be modified manually while the game
is using it, or unspecified phenomena may occur. Edits while the game is using
another database are allowed, but only if the editor knows exactly what he or
she is doing. A file by file copy while the game is not using a database is a
valid backup of that database</p>
<h2><a name="DatabaseVerification">5.6.1 Database verification</a></h2>
<p>If database verification is enabled at startup, the game engine make sure
that all required system database tables are present, that they have the correct
number of rows, and that their data layout templates on disk match the ones the
game engine was compiled with. This allows the game engine to catch simple
errors like version problems and missing tables and rows, but it won't catch all
erroneous data and it will make server startup a little slower.</p>
<p>It is a usually a good idea to keep this option on, especially if the server
was not shut down properly or the database is suspected to be corrupted. Serious
errors will result in the game engine refusing to start up. In this case, a
database restoration from a backup is recommended.</p>
<p>If this option is enabled, every time an empire logs in, the game engine will
make sure that all its tables are present. A failure here will result in the
empire being denied access to the server, and a warning will be posted in the
Almonaster report file.</p>
<h2><a name="Maintaining">5.7 Maintaining the server</a></h2>
<p>Once the server is up and running, some tasks need to be performed in order
to maintain it adequately:
<ul>
  <li>The administrator should establish the correct number of server threads to
    use with the server. If users report delays in the servicing of requests,
    but the reported scripting times are normal, then the threadpool should be
    assigned more threads. On fast multiprocessor systems 50 or more
    simultaneous server threads can be used.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the server is thrashing the disk, in all likelihood it is because there
    is not enough free memory on the computer for <em>Almonaster</em> to run
    properly. In addition to the server process' working set, <i>Almonaster </i>makes
    heavy use of the host operating system's disk buffers, via memory mapped
    files. Insufficient free RAM will cause <i>Almonaster</i> to hit the disk
    for all database accesses.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The administrator must ensure that there is enough disk space available
    for the database to expand as needed. If the database runs out of disk
    space, then data will become corrupted and the server process will probably
    crash. A database with about 250 empires and 20 active games will use about
    10MB of disk space.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The administrator can maintain the server itself via the /admin page
    source<br>
  </li>
  <li>The administrator should log onto the server every once in a while to
    check for messages from other empires. An added bonus is that when an
    administrator logs in, the server is forced to execute all pending updates
    on all closed games on the server, which will free up resources and make the
    server faster for other players.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the server reports an error on startup, the administrator can usually
    determine the cause of the error by examining the <em>Almonaster</em> page
    source's report file.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The server should always be properly shut down, or database errors may
    occur. A proper shutdown is initiated through the admin interface or via the
    'Shutdown Server' button in the Server Administrator page. In case of major
    server problems, a clean shutdown should always be attempted. If the server
    process is terminated without being shutdown properly (because of a server
    crash or an OS or machine crash) inconsistencies may surface in the
    database. The administrator should enable the <strong>VerifyDatabase<em> </em></strong>option
    in the <i>Almonaster</i> config file prior to restarting. If problems
    surface during the database check or afterwards, the administrator can elect
    to kill corrupted games or simply restore a database backup (the latter is
    recommended if essential system tables are damaged). Backups can be either
    restored manually or through the Server Administrator page.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If certain players are determined to be hogging server resources in some
    fashion or other, or making games unpleasant for other players, the
    administrator is encouraged to delete their empires from the server database
    and report the players to their ISP's. <em>Almonaster</em>, like many online
    games, is vulnerable to denial of service attacks and un-sportsmanlike
    behavior on the part of players. If certain IP addresses are determined to
    be responsible for any kind of unacceptable behavior, the administrator can
    block these users via <em>Aljar</em>'s IP address blocking feature.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>It is recommended that administrators set the database to be backed every
    few days during normal server operation. It is important to note that a
    manual directory copy while the game is running does not constitute a valid
    database backup; the backup mechanism actually locks users out of the server
    until a valid copy is made of all the database files, thus ensuring database
    consistency.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Bugs, crashes and memory leaks that can be pinned down to specific actions
    and reproduced should be brought to the attention of the developer or
    current maintainer of the <em>Almonaster</em> source code.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Admin">5.8 The admin page source</a></h2>
<p>The <i>Aljar</i> web server provides a password protected administrative
page source that allows remote administration of the server. <i>Almonaster</i>
administrators may find this useful to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Examine server statistics</li>
  <li>Restart or shut down page sources</li>
  <li>View page source logs and report files</li>
  <li>Restart or shutdown the server</li>
  <li>Release files from the file cache</li>
  <li>Change page source config file parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>The admin page source can be connected to by accessing http://server/admin/</p>
<h2><a name="Compile">5.9 Compilation</a></h2>
<p>Because <i>Almonaster</i> is free software, its source code can be downloaded
and custom modifications can be made. <i>Almonaster</i> is currently available
only for Win32, although ports to other platforms are possible because all
platform dependent functionality is enclosed in the Osal <font size="3">(Operating
System Abstraction Libraries).</font></p>
<h2><a name="CompileOptions">5.9.1 Compilation options</a></h2>
<p><font size="3">Currently, the only compilation option available for <i>Almonaster</i>
is to #define USE_WINS_FOR_GAME_ENTRY in GameEngineConstants.h: this will make
the server use wins instead of <i>Almonaster</i> score to arbitrate game entry
privileges. This option should not be changed one way or another if an existing
database will be used, which is why this is a compile-time option, not
selectable at runtime.</font></p>
<p>There are times when database processing scripts need to be run before the
game starts, in order to upgrade a database or fix data corruption.&nbsp; This
can be done via the HookLibrary option. A hook library must provide the
following export:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" color="#FFFFFF"><code>extern &quot;C&quot;
IAlmonasterHook* AlmonasterHookCreateInstance();</code></font></p>
<p>The IAlmonasterHook interface is defined in IGameEngine.h as follows:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" color="#FFFFFF"><code>class IAlmonasterHook :
virtual public IObject {<br>
public:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual int Initialize (IGameEngine* pGameEngine) = 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual int Setup() = 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual int Running() = 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual int Finalize() = 0;<br>
};</code></font></p>
<p>Initialize() is called when the game engine is beginning to start up. At this
point the database has not been initialized</p>
<p>Setup() is called when the game engine is about to prepare itself to respond
to requests. At this point the database has been initialized but game
verification and initial processing have not yet been performed.</p>
<p>Running() is called when the game engine is completely up and running and is
about to return control to the <i>Alajar </i>web server.</p>
<p>Finalize() is called just before the game engine shuts down, after all games
have been checked for an update one last time. The database is still working at
this point. Immediately after Finalize() is called the AlmonasterHook is
released by the game engine and the library is unmapped.</p>
<p>The return codes from these functions are currently ignored.</p>
<p>The AlmonasterHook source code as it exists in the Alajar source package
contains several common administrative functions that can be used to fix
problems that may occur in the database as a consequence of hypothetical <i>Almonaster</i>
bugs. In order to use these, the AlmonasterHook DLL will need to be customized
as needed and recompiled.</p>
<h2><a name="Win32">5.9.2 The Win32 version</a></h2>
<p>The Win32 versions of <em>Aljar</em> and <i>Almonaster</i> <font size="3">are
compiled and tested with Visual C++ 6.0 SP3 on Windows 2000, and will </font>run
on Windows NT 4.0 SP3 or above. While <em>Aljar</em> and <em>Almonaster</em>
do work on Windows 98 (not Windows 95), there is little reason to use classic
Windows as anything more than a platform for DirectX games. However, <em>Almonaster</em>
can definitely be used as a personal game server on Windows 98, perhaps even
over a dial-up connection.</p>
<p><font size="3">If you are going to compile <em>Almonaster</em> on your
system, you can unzip the zip file containing <i>Almonaster</i> sources into a
clean directory and start building the projects. The order you want to use is
the following:</font>

</ol>
<p><font size="3">Release binaries and libs will go into \release, debug
binaries into \alajar, include files and debug libs into \include</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Win32 version of <i>Almonaster</i> also includes an NT
service build of </font><em>Aljar</em><font size="3"><i>. </i>To install the </font>service,
open a command prompt and run &quot;alajarsvc.exe -install&quot; to install the
service. Then use the control panel to set the service to automatic and start it
up.</p>
<h2><a name="ClientReq">5.10 Client requirements</a></h2>
<p><font size="3"><em>Almonaster</em> clients require an internet connection and
a forms-capable browser, specifically one that supports the POST method. This
would include practically any modern browser: <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape
Navigator</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">Internet Explorer</a>, <a href="http://www.operasoftware.com">Opera</a>
and several others qualify as such.</font></p>
<h2><a name="ServerReq">5.11 Server requirements</a></h2>
<p>Realistic system requirements for an <em>Almonaster</em> server would look
like this:
<ul>
  <li>A supported OS</li>
  <li>25-50 MB of dedicated RAM</li>
  <li>A Pentium 200, although a faster CPU is preferable</li>
  <li>Two hard drives, one for the database, another for backups</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Architecture">5.12 System architecture overview</a></h2>
<p><em>Almonaster </em>is a page-source plug-in for the <a href="alajar.html"><font size="3"><em>Aljar</em></font></a>
web server. This means that the <em>Almonaster</em> game code registers itself
as the recipient of HTTP requests that come with a certain URI (Uniform Resource
Identifier). For example, a typical configuration of <font size="3"><em>Aljar</em>
would delegate HTTP requests for anything under http://www.server.com/almonaster/
to the <em>Almonaster</em> page-source; the page-source would respond by
supplying HTML code to return to the client.</font></p>
<p><em>Almonaster</em> itself is based on a modular design that incorporates the
following components:
<ol>
  <li>The <em>page-source </em>module: implements <em><font size="3">Aljar</font></em>'s
    event-driven interface.</li>
  <li><font size="3"><em>Webpage </em>modules: implement the functionality of
    the different game pages.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">The <em>Game-Engine </em>module: controls the rules of the
    game and serves information to the web pages.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">The <em>Database </em>module: stores data for each player
    and provides data caching to ensure responsive performance</font>.</li>
</ol>
