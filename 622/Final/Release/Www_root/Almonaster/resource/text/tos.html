<h2>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
This server provides services to users subject to the terms of service 
(hereafter referred to as &quot;TOS&quot;) listed in this document. The TOS can be updated or modified at any time without user notification. 
The most recent version of the TOS will always be available on this server. When 
using services on this server, users are subject to the rules and
    guidelines outlined in the TOS. In order to playing on this server, users 
must explicitly accept the TOS.<p>The TOS constitutes the entire agreement 
between users and the administrators of this server. The failure of the latter 
to enforce any right or provision of the TOS does not constitute a renunciation 
of such a right or provision. Violations of the TOS should be reported with due 
celerity to the administrators of this server, who nevertheless do not have the 
responsibility to act immediately on such notification. It is up to the 
administrators' discretion to establish sanctions for specific instances of TOS 
violations.</p>
<h2>2. Description of service</h2>
<p>This server provides users with an online gaming experience, which includes 
the opportunity to interact with other players. These services, as well as 
future modifications and additions to the same, are subject to the TOS. Services are provided &quot;AS-IS&quot; and come with no warranty. The 
administrators of this server are not responsible for any problems that 
might arise from use of these service, including but not limited to data loss,
    downtime, deletion or modification of user settings, abuses of the service (such as 
other users cheating
    or creating offensive or adult content) perpetrated by other users of the services.&nbsp;The administrators 
of this server reserve the right to modify or discontinue any set of services 
without notice,
    temporarily or permanently, and they shall not
    be liable to users for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the
    services.</p>
<p>Users of this server are responsible for the access fees their internet 
service providers or telcos might charge them while using these services. </p>
<h2>3. User obligations</h2>
Users may not use these services in such a way that might be considered
    offensive or annoying to other users.&nbsp;More specifically, behavior such as
    the following may result in the suspension or termination of user accounts on
    this server:<ul>
  <li> Exploiting bugs in the services without notifying the administrators of 
  this server.</li>
  <li> Using multiple accounts in a single game (except when playing alone, or 
  when tolerated
    by other players in the same game).</li>
  <li> Using language that might be offensive by the
    standards of the community of users of this server.</li>
  <li> Uploading material  that might be offensive by the
    standards of the community of users of this server.</li>
  <li> Uploading material that breaks a law or a contract.</li>
  <li> Uploading material that violates copyright beyond the rights granted by 
  fair use and parody.</li>
  <li> Uploading material that  could be considered a form of solicitation.</li>
  <li> Uploading material that  was
    designed to be harmful to other users.</li>
  <li> Stalking or harassing other users.</li>
  <li> Sending
    unsolicited or hostile messages to other users beyond the natural course of 
  a game.</li>
  <li> Stealing the passwords of other users.</li>
  <li> Impersonating other users or the administrators of this server.</li>
  <li> Interfering with or maliciously disrupting the functionality of this 
  server.</li>
  <li> Attempting to use another user's account, or denying or disrupting the 
  ability of other users to enjoy these services.</li>
  <li> Collecting or storing personal data belonging to other users without
    their permission.</li>
  <li> Harming minors in any way.</li></ul>
<p>In addition to these universal restrictions, there may be other behavioral 
conventions in place on this server that were established by the user community 
as commonly accepted user etiquette. These may include restrictions on 
diplomatic maneuvers within games or regulations concerning the language and 
content of messages. These conventions should be followed wherever possible as a 
matter of social grace, but do not constitute violations of the TOS and should 
not be brought to the attention of the administrators of this server.</p>
Because of the nature of the services provided,
    the administrators of this server cannot guarantee that all content accessible by
    children on this server will conform to &quot;family friendly&quot;
    standards. For this reason and because of the
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/coppa/index.htm">Children's 
Online Privacy Protection Act</a>, children under 13 are discouraged from using 
this server. The server will ask users when they create their accounts to 
testify that they are over 13 years of age. Children under 13 who wish to 
deceive the administrators of this server in order to use its services should 
understand that they participating at their own risk and that for their own good 
they should not provide any personal information even when prompted by the 
server or by fellow players. They should also obtain explicit permission from 
their parents or legal guardians, and enjoy their supervision at all times while 
playing.<p>The administrators of this server may not be held responsible for any 
damage that might result from the interaction of one user with another. Users 
may report TOS violators to the administrators for consideration of sanctions, 
but the administrators cannot be expected to police every last detail of the 
contact between many diverse human beings. Users should exercise good judgment 
and be instinctively cautious when providing any personal information to the 
server or to other users.</p>
The  administrators of this server may not be held responsible for any
    damage or loss that should result from the use of these services or their 
absence. Users should not take the services offered on this server with 
excessive seriousness.<h2>4. Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This section discusses how users' personal information is handled by the 
administrators of this server. All personal information provided by users  is subject to
    this  privacy policy. Data that may not have been explicitly provided as such 
by users, but could be correlated with personal information, such as IP 
addresses, user actions and information in cookies (hereafter referred to as 
&quot;correlated information&quot;), is also subject to this privacy policy.</p>
All personal information provided by users on this server is optional. Most of 
this information is viewable to other users, and is stored for display purposes 
and for sharing with other users. Some information may be marked as viewable by 
administrators only, and is stored for various administrative purposes, such as 
email notifications or sending users their forgotten passwords.<p>No personal 
information will be shared by the administrators of this server, with the 
exception of displaying information as viewable to other users. No use will be 
made of the email addresses provided by users beyond display and administrative 
services as mentioned above. No financial gain will be enjoyed by anyone 
connected or related to this server as a result of the use in any fashion 
whatsoever of personal information provided by users.</p>
<p>Because of the requirements of standard server logging, as well as the 
service features requiring statistical tables and historical information, some 
correlated information will be stored on the server. This information may 
include records of a users' public activity inside of the services, as well as user actions performed while using these
    services.&nbsp;Users must understand that the user of this service implies 
an implicit agreement that
    such information concerning their actions on the server may be recorded and 
displayed to other users when features of the services demand it. This category 
of data includes, but is not limited to, final and intermediate results of 
games, actions taken during game-play or messages sent or broadcast to other 
users.</p>
<p>Correlated information that might reveal personal information otherwise 
undisclosed, such as IP addresses and cookie information, will be either 
obfuscated or hidden from the eyes of other users.</p>
This server may use cookies to enhance the user's experience, and to provide 
certain features of the services. The data contained in cookies created by this 
server is limited to:<ul>
  <li>Remembering user interface information, account identifiers and passwords 
  to facilitate ease of use.</li>
  <li>Uniquely identifying user sessions for purposes of maintaining quality of 
  service, such as multiple account use detection services. If users are 
  discovered to be violating the TOS based on information obtained from cookies 
  (or IP addresses), they may be blocked from participation in certain services. 
  They may also receive admonishment from the administrators of this server at 
  their personal email addresses, and their accounts may suffer from the 
  sanctions discussed in section 5. The information gleaned from cookies in this 
  manner may be shared with other users if the violation of the TOS merits such 
  notification. For example, tools provided to users to detect or block the use 
  of multiple accounts inside a game may inform them which accounts are in 
  violation of the standards set by the server or the creator of the game. 
  However, even in these cases, no other information beyond the publicly 
  available and freely disclosed will be provided to other users and&nbsp; no 
  specific information will be disclosed concerning the violation. For example, 
  duplicate IP addresses may be reported, but the specific IP addresses that are 
  duplicated will not be disclosed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users may decline to use cookies with this server. However, they should be 
aware that doing so may degrade the quality of service offered by this server, 
and is not a recommended or supported practice. In the future, this server may 
not be usable without cookies.</p>
<p>The administrators of this server will make every attempt within their power 
to keep information such as private email addresses or passwords from being 
disclosed. However, neither the internet nor real life is a perfectly secure 
environment, and accidental disclosures happen every day in both spheres. This 
server was designed to be as secure as possible within the limitations of its 
budget. However, users should err on the side of caution and not entrust this 
server with information that they might deem truly confidential. For example, 
account passwords on this server that are identical to passwords used for other 
online services are a clear security risk, because disclosure from one web site 
can jeopardize the security of another site and lead to impersonation and
<a href="http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/index.html">identity theft</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>5. User Accounts</h2>
Users may delete their accounts at any time.&nbsp;Some information
    related to a user's activities on the server may remain after the account
    has been deleted, but only for the purpose of providing  features such as 
statistical tables and historical information to other users.&nbsp;No personal  information will
    remain on this server after an account has been deleted.<p>User accounts may be 
suspended or deleted by the  administrators of this server at their
    discretion, based on the rules and guidelines outlined in this TOS. The  administrators 
of this server will accept no liability for the deletion of any
    data, material or information should a user's account be terminated.</p>
<p>User accounts are protected by passwords. Users are responsible for 
maintaining the secrecy of the passwords that protect their accounts, and should 
not share them with other users. Certain features used to monitor single players 
using multiple accounts in games can work in unexpected ways when users make use 
of other users' accounts. As with all authentication services, there exists the 
risk of attacks against user passwords using various mechanisms. The 
administrators of this server are not responsible for any pernicious effects 
that the success of such attempts might cause.</p>
<p>User accounts may not be purchased or transferred for commercial purposes 
without the explicit permission of the administrators of this server.</p>
<h2>6. User provided content</h2>
Users may upload content, data or information to this server. This may include text, images, 
hyperlinks and other resources. All uploaded material remains the property and 
responsibility of the user. However, the act of uploading material grants the 
server the right of royalty-free reasonable use within the boundaries of the 
features of the service, including the display, adaptation or reproduction of 
the content. Nonetheless, it does not grant other users these rights. For 
example, if a user uploads an account icon, no rights are automatically 
conferred to other users regarding its use or duplication. Copyright issues 
involving two users should be resolved between them, without involving the 
administrators of this server.<p>Users are free to
    delete their uploaded material whenever they see fit.</p>
<p>The administrators will accept no responsibility for the nature of content 
uploaded by users to this server, even when that content is in violation of the 
TOS or any local or international laws. Users agree to indemnify  this server and its administrators or
    affiliates, and hold them harmless from any claim or demand, including attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of 
content
    they upload or transmit through these services. The administrators of this 
server reserve the right to remove or modify material belonging to users that 
are in violation of the TOS or local or international law, in order to avoid 
legal liability or simply to preserve the quality of environment of the 
community that uses the server.</p>
<p>No material, data
    or information submitted to this server should be considered secret or secure. 
Even if the server specifically states that the information is for the eyes of 
the administrators only, it is possible for the information to be obtained by 
authorities with legal weapons to wield.</p>
